<h1 align='center'> Experienced Developer? Try this!.</h1>

<p align='center'>
  <strong> If you want to have the best performance possible and you understand at least the basics of developing, you could also head to the <code>framework.lua</code> on both the client side and server side, remove all of the code there and add a shared script to the <code>fxmanifest.lua</code> with your frameworks import file, if it supports one. The frameworks in here by default all support imports.</strong><br><br>
