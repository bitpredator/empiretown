# CHANGELOGS

# 03/10/2022

Added exports as per request:
 OpenUI()
 CloseUI()

If you choose, you can now disable opening of the menu by hotkey by setting Controls["Toggle"] = false.
With this, you will have to control the opening of the menu via the export function.

Version number not changed as the update is loaded remotely.
